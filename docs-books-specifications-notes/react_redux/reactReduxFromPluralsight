https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-flux-building-applications/table-of-contents

use strict = good idea.

can be used just to wrap a part of the file.

react component has props and state

props are passed down from parent, are immutable
state should only be used on top comp, pass it via props to the children.
-see getDefaultProps for defaulting properties.

various lifecycle methods, e.g.

componentWillMount, componentDidUpdate, etc.
NOTE: the will and did pattern,
NOTE: there are e.g. shoulds, e.g. shouldComponentUpdate .... prevent un-necessary re rendering if u want.

componentWillUnmount... when it is just about to be pulled off the DOM.

keys: e.g. u are displaying stuff in a table:

<tr key ="person.id">... etc.
