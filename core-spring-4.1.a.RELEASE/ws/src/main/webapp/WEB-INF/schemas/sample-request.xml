<!--	TODO 02: Run the "ws-1 Trang.launch" file to generate the schema (right click on file, "Run As/1 ws-1 Trang".
		Trang will create src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/schemas/trang-schema.xsd.  
		Refresh the project to see this file.
		Inspect the file, Trang should have generated amount as xs:decimal and the others as xs:string.
		Manually modify the schema as needed. -->
