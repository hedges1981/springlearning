In

    application. In the second section, you will manage login and "access denied" scenarios.
    In the third section, you will handle unsuccessful attempts to log in. In the fourth section, you will 
	configure some additional users and roles and experiment with different role-based access rules. In the final section,
    you will use the security tag library to display links and data based on
    role.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e4603"></a>13.3.1.&nbsp;Setting up Spring Security in the application</h3></div></div></div><p>Currently, the Reward Network web application allows any user to not only view Account information, but also to edit Account
      information.  Of course, in a typical application, certain roles would most likely be required for those actions. The first step
      in enforcing such role-based access is to intercept the requests corresponding to those actions. Spring Security utilizes standard
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Servlet Filters</em></span> to make that possible.</p><p>(TODO-01) Begin by <a href="appendix-wtp-server.html" title="Appendix&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Using Web Tools Platform (WTP)">deploying the web application</a> for

        <a href="http://localhost:8080/security" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/security</a>.
        You should see a link to 'View Account List'; click on this link and the list of accounts
        should appear.  Be sure the application start successfully before moving on to the next step.  
        You may wish to remove previous projects from your server to allow for quicker startup.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="details.filter-setup"></a>13.3.2.&nbsp;Define the Filter class</h3></div></div></div><p>(TODO-02) Open <code class="classname">SecurityWebInitializer</code> (within the

        see that it extends <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer</code>, or would if this code were not
        commented out.  Remove this comment and save your work; the superclass code contains all the logic needed to 
        setup the required <code class="literal">springSecurityFilterChain</code> needed to enable the Spring Security.  There
        are other ways to setup this filter as it is just a standard Servlet Filter, see

        security configuration into the <code class="filename">RootConfig</code> class.  
        (The name of the class is <code class="filename">SecurityConfig</code> and is located
        in the same config package as the <code class="filename">RootConfig</code> class).
        This will include those beans when bootstrapping the application context.</p><p>At this point, the filter should be fully configured and ready
        to intercept incoming requests. Save all work, restart the server (or wait for the server to restart) and

        You should see a link to 'View Account List'; click on this link.
        If your filter is configured correctly, then you
        <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> get a 404 response. This happens because
        the resource mapped to <code class="literal">accountList.htm</code> is

  Normally there is no way to get back the password from a sha-256 hash, at least not with 
  mathematics, but in the Internet you will find so called Rainbow Tables which are
  lookup tables for pre-generated hash/plaintext values. Sometimes you can even enter
  the hash value in google and get back the plaintext. By appending a salt to the user
  password before the hash is calculated this attack is more difficult, often infeasible.
  In real life we would recommend to append a salt to the user password.
