quotd - the web app created in chapter 1 of book.




chapter 1      ******************************88888888

- created QuoteController.groovy

-**********************
 note on page 17, when you brought in the stylesheet and the images they ended up having to go nithe grails-app/assets folder
for it to work

- created the QuoteDomain class using:
-grails create-domain-class quote
-note that this created the file Quote.groovy


***********Datasource.... book talks about a file named DataSource.groovy, however it seems that is this grail version
(3.x) the datasources are in file conf/application.yml instead.

NOTE on the persistent h2 file:

- run the command ;- grails run-app from the folder:
grails_learning/qotd
NOTE: the db url of:
jdbc:h2:./devDb;MVCC=TRUE;LOCK_TIMEOUT=10000;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE

the ./devDb means it is pointing to a persistent db file in the folder: grails_learning/qotd


***** SAVING STUFF TO THE DB, seep book p.20, ran the console from the qotd folder, and it worked ok.
NOTE: the grails console command i) fires up the web app along with a groovy console to do stuff with it.
 new quote created by running:  new qotd.Quote(author: 'king kong', content:'I am king kong').save().. note the
 save() method on the domain object, this is also added in by Grails.


*****SCAFFOLDING, see in QuoteController.groovy the scafolding = Qote bit, this auto sets up scaffolding for the Quote
entity, see at eg> http://localhost:8080/quote/index for how it auto rigs up view+controller to allow to do CRUD operations.


*****VALIDATION CONSTRAINTS: see book p.24 / the Quote.groovy entity, for how the validation is put on the class,
// //NOTE that it appears that if you break validation that is done server-side,
          //it gives you a shite error message rather than one actually telling you what is the issue.


********* p. 25: CREATED A SERVICE
ran: grails create-service quote
this created the service groovy file in      service/qotd.
see the QuoteController for how it is i) injected into a controller and used.

****** p. 27:  BIT ABOUT TESTING
See the QuoteServiceSpec.groovy that was auto created when we created the QuoteSerivce
NOTE******TO RUN A TEST: rather than what the book says, this command seems to be the one to use to run the QuoteServiceSpec test:
grails test-app -unit QuoteServiceSpec
