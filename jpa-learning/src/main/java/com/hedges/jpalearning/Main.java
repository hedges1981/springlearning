        //NOTE: SEE  BOOK PAGE 319 regarding dangers of un expectedly modifying the db by using sql, basically if a native sql query gets mapped to an entity,

        //NOTE: native sql can also be used to do inserts and updates, example of an insert:

        //TODO: work through this section, ( looks very very dull )

        //*******************LIFECYCLE CALLBACKS *******************************************
        //JPA has the following lifecycle events, on which actions can be fired:
        //PrePersist, PostPersist, PreUpdate, PostUpdate, PreRemove, PostRemove, and PostLoad.

        /*
        Pre-persist : - is called when entityManager.persist(,,) is called on an entity. If an entity tree has persist: cascade on it the each entity
        in the cascade gets the event fired.

        Post-persist :- called when the entities insert statement is actually done, normally in the process of flushing the persisence context and committing the
        transaction. The firing of post-persist does not mean the txn has successfully committed, it can still get rolled back even if post-persist has been fired.

        PreRemove:- gets called when entityManager.remove(..) is called.

        PostRemove:- gets called when the delete statement is sent to the db. Again, it's calling doesn't indicate success, as the overall txn could still get rolled back.

        PreUpdate: - called at some point between an entity being updated and the change being pushed to the db. The point at which it is called is
        implementation specific, also the number of times it gets called if an entity is updated > 1 time in a txn is also vendor specific.

        PostUpdate: - called after the update statement is fired at the db. Again as with the others the enclosing transaction could be rolled back, so there is no guarantee that it
        means the change has been permanently made.

        PostLoad :- called after an entity has been read from the db and its object constructed. Will also fire as a result of a lazy initialisation, Can also fire if
        entityManager.refresh() is called.

        NOTE: with all the event firings, they also get fired if things like persist, remove, etc are cascaded down entity trees.

        NOTE: you can only annotate one method on an entity with a given callback annotation, if there is > 1, that application startup fails.
         */

        //NOTE: when on entities, callback methods are executed from within the context of the current transaction and entity manager.

        //NOTE: methods on entities get called AFTER those on an entity listener.

        //AORMLifecycleCallbackDemo is annotated with all of the above callback methods, see the output of this code to see them in action:

        //triggers the pre and post persist:
        generalService.create10LifeCycleCallBackDemos();
        //triggers the PostLoad, pre update and post update:
        generalService.updateAllLifecycleCallbackDemos();
        //triggers the pre-remove and post-remove methods:
        generalService.deleteAllLifecycleCallBackDemos();

        //*****************************ENTITY LISTENERS ***********************
        //--allow you to move the call-back code off the entity into another class.
        //check the logs for this operation to see i) that the entity listeners have been called and ii) that the order fired reflects the order declared on the class:
        generalService.createLifeCycleCallbackDemoWithString( "validString" );

        //NOTE: methods on entity listeners get called BEFORE those on an entity.

        //NOTE: you can only annotate one method on an entity listener with a given callback annotation, if there is > 1, that application startup fails.

        //NOTE: how this one causes AORMLifeCycleCallBackDemoEntityListener1 to throw an exception, demos how the entity listeners
        //can be used for validation, and how  an exception from the validation stops a txn getting committed.

        /*
        See book p.330 about these,
        - can only be declared in an XML mapping file, not via annotations.
        - order rules are:
        i) default listeners executed in order declared in the xml mappings file
        ii) they fire before any of the more specific ones declared at the entity level

        USE: @ExcludeDefaultListeners to exclude an entity from all of the default listeners
         */

        //******************ORDER OF CALL BACK METHODS WHEN INHERITANCE IS INVOLVED*****************

        //see book pages: 331-332,
        /*
        CALLBACK METHODS ON ENTITY CLASSES: get called in the order of the inheritance hierachy, with the super class first
        THEY NEED TO BE IN A CLASS THAT IS ANNOTATED WITH @Entity or @MappedSuperClass

        CALLBACK METHODS ON ENTITY LISTENERS: the superclass' entity listeners get called before sub classes,

        BASIC RULES FOR ORDERING ARE:
        - default listeners in the order defined in the XML mapping file.
        - entity listeners in the order defined on each class, descending down the hierarchy.
        - entity callback methods, descending down the class hierarchy

         * the persistence unit and the relationships it defines are bypassed by the bulk stuff.

        NOTE, the same idea can be used to do a bulk delete.
        NOTE, the persistence context does not automatically refresh when a bulk delete/update is done, so it can get out of sync
        with what is actually in the DB.

        RECOMMENDATION then is to either i) always do the bulk stuff at the start of the transaction, i.e. before anything is actually read
        into the persistence context, or do a bulk update/delete always in its own isolated txn.
