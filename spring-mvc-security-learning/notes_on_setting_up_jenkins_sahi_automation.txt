SETTING A NO GUI JENKINS BOX UP FOR RUNNING SAHI TESTS-- USING HEADLESS SAHI AND A HEADLESS BROWSER (FF WITH XVFB)

Installed xvfb by:

yum install xorg-x11-server-Xvfb

Install the xvfb plugin on Jenkins.

Got hold of sahi 'community' edition and got the installation jar.

from /home/rowland.hall ran: java -jar install_sahi_v50_20141105.jar sahi-no-gui-install.xml

note the need for the sahi-no-gui-install.xml file. This allows it to be installed without a gui. To generate one, install it on abox with a GUI,
then generate an XML script at the end. Be careful of the installation folder specified in the xml file.


Installed firefox:

yum install firefox

Start sahi, (note sahi was installed in /opt/sahi, could have been put anywhere):

/opt/sahi/userdata/bin/start_sahi.sh

when you start sahi, it looks like it picks up firefox and sets up e.g.a folder in:

......sahi/userdata/browser/ff/

Add firefox xvfb browser to sahi:

Put this in /opt/sahi/userdata/config/browser_types.xml

note that it is using DISPLAY 1. Besure that the the jenkins build is set to use that display number also, see the
Xvfb specific display name bit of the build config options.

<browserType>
<name>firefox-xvfb</name>
<displayName>Firefox</displayName>
<icon>firefox.png</icon>
<path>env DISPLAY=:1 firefox</path>
<options>-profile "$userDir/browser/ff/profiles/sahi$threadNo" -no-remote</options>
