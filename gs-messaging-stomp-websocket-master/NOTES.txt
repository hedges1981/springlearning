This project follows example tutorial from here:
https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket/


Notes: additional stuff made by me to demo 'multiplexing', > 1 topic over the same web socket?


see app.js where it subscribest to topics
/topic/testTopic/1
/topic/testTopic/2

See WebSocketPublishingService.java for thing that pushes messages down those topics.

to test all this:

start app:

go to: http://localhost:8080/

Connect to the websockets:

U will see loads of annoying alerts popping up!
